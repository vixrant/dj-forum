## Forum Application for DJ Literary Society

## Technology Stack
- **Misago Forum Framework Built on top of a Django Framework**

## Notes
1. The pages are generated using React.js.
2. Misago is kinda picky when it comes to customisable.

TO EDIT THE FRONTEND:
1. cd MisagoFront
2. Edit the gulp file to target Misago's template folder.
3. Run gulp watchstyle.

Then you can easily touch the LESS files. Use dev tools in browser.
